# speechtocypher
An experiment on how to integrate speech to text with the Cypher queryÂ language

For finetuning upload the .ipynb notebook and google colab and choose the GPU runtime, upload to the runtime the Archivio.zip file and unzip it.
After running all notebook cells download the speech_recognition_model.pt file and put it in the speechtocypherdata folder

In the end install requirements with pip from the requirements.txt file and you're ready to run (some neo4j connections and comments should be changed)
